\section{Similar Concepts}
The idea of a political simulator similar to that of our project has been played with before
in the gaming industry. Three games, Civilization IV, Rulers of Nations, and Sim City are within the
simulation category of games and, although the designers make many decisions based upon enjoyment, 
some interesting characteristics can be gleaned. Their models are somewhat more complex than the ones
we propose, however they lack the scientific rigourous testing validation that a research system
requires. Our model looks for emergent behaviour as opposed to imposing particular attributes on the 
agents, the environment and the simulation as a whole.
