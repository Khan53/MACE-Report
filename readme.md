Formatting Guidelines
---------------------

- Always start sentences in LaTeX source files with a new line. (Don't want a single character change show up as a big chunk of text in diff tools, also good for avoiding conflicts)

- Do not let and invidiual line become to long. It is generally nice to wrap them somewhere around the 80-100 character mark

- For maths, avoid the <code>eqnarray</code> environment, use <code>align</code> instead.
